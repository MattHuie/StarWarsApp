# StarWarsApp

In this app, users would be able to scroll through the planets and names of people in the Star Wars universe. This app was created using the Star Wars Api (https://swapi.co/).

## StarWarsApp MVP Checklist Requirements

-[x] For the People endpoint, the application should display at least:
  o Name
  o Hair color
  o Eye color
  o Birth year
  o Date created 
-[x] For Planets endpoint, the application should display at least:
  o Name
  o Climate
  o Population
  o Date created
-[x] Implement infinite scroll - the API captures pagination with the `next ` and `previous` properties

## Built With
* AVFoundation
* UIKit

## Prerequisites
* Xcode - 10.0+
* iOS 11.0+ / iPad Pro (9.7, 10.5 or 12.9) / iPad (2017 +)
* Swift 4.0+

## Future Implementations
* Include an image/sprite for each name in the Star Wars api and have to displayed alongside their information. 

* If possible I would like to find all the images of the planets that are in the API and rebuild the planets tableview to have augemented reality functionality. This would show each planet in augemented reality and users would be able to tap on them to learn about them. This would make the app for interactive.
